This is a simple HTML webpage designed to showcase the launch of the TX7 Gaming Console. It highlights the console's new features, game access benefits, and compares it with the previous TX6 model.

This project is built using pure HTML — no CSS or JavaScript — to practice the basic structure of a web page, including headings, lists, tables, images, and links.
